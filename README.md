#MineLib.Net

MineLib.Net is a .net library which provides functionality to communicate with a minecraft server or client through the minecraft protocol. It is constructed to support many different versions without any code changes.

Currently it supports minecraft version 1.0.0 up to the latest pre release (make sure you pick the 1.4_Dev branch to get support for minecraft pre releases between 1.3 and 1.4).

It can work either as a client or a server.
